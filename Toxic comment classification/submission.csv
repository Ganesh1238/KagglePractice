 ==Speedy deletion of Weblogtr.com== 
  A tag has been placed on Weblogtr.com, requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done under section G4 of the criteria for speedy deletion, because the article appears to be a repost of material that was previously deleted following a deletion debate, such as at articles for deletion. Under the specified criteria, where an article has substantially identical content to that of an article deleted after debate, and any changes in the content do not address the reasons for which the material was previously deleted, it may be deleted at any time.  

 If you think that this notice was placed here in error, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the page (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag), coupled with adding a note on the article's talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the article that would would render it more in conformance with Wikipedia's policies and guidelines.

 : I originally assumed that the version of the story I heard (that in the passage from """"we shall fight on the beaches"""" to """"we shall never surrender"""", all the words are from Old English roots, except 'surrender' which is from French) was a joke (someone having a poke at the French) - but it's absolutely correct! 
 : I checked this all out in the Online Etymological Dictionary, and every word in that clip is from Old English - with the exception of 'surrender' which is indeed from Old French! (And apologies to anyone with French ancestry/links - I have not forgotten Verdun). 
 : Since this is an interesting factoid (well, the Old English part, not the part about 'surrender'), and since it is something that seems to come up often (particularly as that section of this speech is so universally known), I think it's worth mentioning in the article, something along the lines of:

 Sol system (based on Latin Sol=sun) is perfectly workable. Besides, using the term """"solar system"""" with aliens would not present a problem either. Aliens don't speak English, at least not as a native language. We could also create a name for our home planet.

 Hi Jim, 

 I dealt with a number of things you recommended... 
 * Regarding heading capitalization structure... fixed. 
 * Regarding bulleted lists...  I get what you're saying but I still haven't found what I feel is a better way than lists for conveying certain points.  I think it's the decades of corporate in me.  Maybe ideas will come up as more people start to review the page. 
 * Regarding the use of ® ™ or © symbols...  The symbols are actually part of the title of the referenced document.  Once I integrated the references, these symbols floated down to and were buried in the References section.  They seem less noticeable there but I'll eliminate them if you think tampering with the original reference's title is the right thing to do. 
 * Regarding your comments on the History section and integrating references via the use of prose...  I rewrote everything and did my best to follow your advice.  It may not be perfect yet, but I think it's closer and, you're right, I agree that the more neutral it becomes, the better it reads.  I also restructured the article to have the Types of solutions and services offered section follow the history in manner that makes it act more as an extension of the history, with the references to help support it.  It uses bullets and you probably won't like it but I feel like this is one of those cases where a bulleted list seems to fit.

The Founding Fathers didn't want to get rid of their slaves is because they could not give up their services. It was a vice not a necessary evil as some would think. The Constitution is all about what the country is supposed to turn out as not what they wanted right then. They knew they weren't perfect, but people still deify them.

Perhaps """"that's all I have to say about that"""" though, as to anyone who does not already understand any explanation would most likely be as pointless as it would be meaningless.   What I do want to add though is my belated vote against the US hegemony here onwiki, a US organ despite the hoopla, and for this article to be renamed """"Cum hoc ergo propter hoc"""". The comedy title: """"Correlation does not mean causation"""", could be redirected accordingly.  But maybe I am just caught up in """"old world"""" nonsense and should actually assist the process, bravely illustrated here, similarly retitling medical articles such as Pneumonia which of course should be retitled: """"Inflammation of the lungs"""".

Modus operandi should be given a down to earth title such as """"Method of operation"""" or, if that's still too pompous, then maybe """"Way of doing things"""".   The article Ad hoc should become """"for this"""", or maybe """"Solution designed for a specific problem or task"""".

"Of course anything to do with safe drinking water or unsafe drinking water is relevant, but being relevant does not mean it belongs in the article. If it is relevant and integral to the article, in it should go, but as far as I can make out, it is not integral to this article, but to the fraccing issue in general. As such it should go into fraccing articles, and though it might well rate a mention in this article, all such a mention should comprise is that there are concerns and controversies on fraccing safety and desirability, with links to the most relevant fraccing articles. If you think that those articles do not mention the drinking water issues in sufficient detail and balance, go to the fraccing articles to make up the deficiency, not here. Otherwise we finally wind up with a separate (and very likely conflicting) fraccing discussion in every drinking water article for every major community in the Eastern US. And each of those will need its own updating and reconciliation etc. In short: a mess. Mention fraccing by all means. But do not explain, argue or enlarge at all in this article.  If you want to expound, feel welcome, but do it in articles where it will be appreciated. The principle has nothing to do with fraccing as such; it has to do with decent construction of articles.

 I caught your note at Talk:Eyeka and am responding here instead of there because the talk page of a deleted page should also be deleted.  

 Without access to the text of the deleted article I can't provide you with specific reasons as to why I requested deletion, but can only provide general reasons why I tag articles for deletion as """"unambiguous advertising/promotion"""". I should note that ultimately an administrator has the final say when it comes to deleting articles, and I am not an administrator. I identified the article as """"unambiguous advertising/promotion"""" either because it was written from the perspective of telling the readers how great the subject is, or it was written with a great deal of flowery filler words that if removed would have left the article with almost nothing. Another factor here is that the article made no credible claim to meeting the notability criteria for inclusion. In order for an article to remain on Wikipedia, it must contain reliable, independent references that establish the claims made in the article and that it meets the inclusion criteria.  

 If you would like me to provide specific details as to how the article you contributed met the generalizations I outlined above, please contact user , the administrator who deleted the article, and request that it be """"userfied"""". This means that the article will be placed in your user space, not as an encyclopedia article, but as a draft to be worked on.

 Can I repost the same info without putting the salons website info on it. she is actually the first person to have to word trademarked and its on file with the commomwealth of Virginia state corporation commission.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by   •    
 :The most important issue is whether the term has received coverage in third-party media, like a story in a major newspaper. Trademarking isn't significant on its own - Wikipedia determines notability by reference to multiple instances of coverage. See WP:NOTE.  If the term has widespread use, it could be included. If it's restricted to a single salon (and I would think it would be if it's trademarked - that's the point of trademarking), then it's unlikely to be notable. In no case would a link to the salon be appropriate.    

 :::This term is used nationwide, however this person was the first to trademark it. The word had been in circulation since the late 90's but locs were not as popular then. It is semi popular but just as the dreadlock community is growing so is the popularity of the word. just google it.

They predicted a similar fate for the poultry industry. But they didn’t propose any solution for this decline. 

 Robert Turner, UNRWA’s director of operations in the Gaza Strip, told Haaretz that he “read the draft with concern.

 AIthough I'm sure you tried 
 You caII the house

 To make sure we're aIive

 Haminoon:  No, my edit wasn't redundant.  Here's why:  My addition of """"child"""" to """"child sexual abuse"""" indicates that the victim in question was under the age of consent.  But the fact that the age was given as """"15"""" doesn't inform the reader what the age of consent was in the jurisdiction in question.  Unless the reader was already aware of the age of consent in Oregon, he wouldn't know that sex with a 15-year-old counted, legally speaking, as a specific level of offense in that state.  In any case, I was following the instructions in the page """"Sexual Abuse"""" when I added that word, """"child"""".  You didn't explain why you felt that rule was inappropriate to follow.

"== Nine Years War/ Cogadh na Naoi mBliana == 

 First, the use of 'rebel' to decribe the native Irish does in fact imply that Irish resistance to English rule was unusual, was exceptional. The word in this context was designed to establish English rule as the norm in society. Ciarán Brady devotes some time to discussing this in his book on Shane O Neill/Seán an Díomais and points out that it was O Neill and his struggles which represented the norm in society and, if any group had been 'rebelling', it was the English government of Ireland which was rebelling against the norm. It is a thoughtless word for a professional historian to use; an acceptance of the English view of the time as fact. Second, because Irish-born worked in the English government doesn't make it less colonial, no more than Algerian-born Pied Noir working for the French made the French government in Algeria less colonial. In fact, native-born workers are part of every colonial government and all works on colonialism and settler-colonialism incorporate them into the structure of those types of government. Third, to claim that the government was 'Irish domestic' implies that domestic Irish concerns were at its heart. With just a flicker of thought towards the English attitude towards the Gaelic world, Ireland's majority culture, this is patently untrue. The refusal to allow even Irish-born Old English head the government confirms that in English eyes the nascent Old English community was not to be trusted in government (and they were not). It was a government which was fully controlled by the English, most especially from Sussex's deputyship, and to claim it was a 'domestic Irish' government is simply ahistorical. The resistance to English policies from 1556 to 1583, and the ultimate defeat of the Old English, confirms beyond doubt English colonial control over the government.",dbeccb1210c32b3d,0.004859899031632316,0.015339607310668236,0.011828246269910296,0.00295045402861461,0.0015499050732181623,0.023093272863910823

 == A tentative question == 

 A thought has belatedly struck me.  

 I have been puzzled by your monomania, first about """"unnecessary"""" words in Wikipedia and now about NPOV articles. By any standards your behaviour is unusual and even self-destructive. It is clear that editing Wikipedia matters to you and yet you have placed yourself in a situation where you are quite likely to be banned for a substantial length of time.  

 So can I ask, in the gentlest possible way, if you have any personal issues that might lead you to behave so obsessively? Because if so that would change the entire nature of the discussion at WP/ANI. I am certain that the other editors would respond positively if you had a problem.

 I moved """"Cuon"""" to """"Cuon alpinus"""" because that's the correct name for the species (see Dhole), and according to that article it is also the only species of that genus, so the content will be exactly the same. I started creating an article for every species on Category:Vulpini and continued with doing so. There are not too many animal pictures on commons yet, but looking in the future I think it is good to have an article (or category or whatever it will be) for every species. I filled Vulpes vulpes with some pictures already, and I think it will grow much much bigger than that in the future. I just started editing some animal articles the way I think they should look like, and I welcome a discussion about this. I am not aware of any policy on this, maybe that's the reason why there is not too much order in the animal categories yet.

 Hello and thanks for the welcome message!  Also, a quick question.  I'm doing a little housecleaning and am too new to know your/the community's preferences.  If I see a name to clarify, I don't know if it is best to create a redirect or to use a piped link.  Example: for Eurlyne/Arlene Howell, I think I actually did both.  Now I have noticed that Erica Marie Commeau (Miss Maine USA 2005) has a page without her middle name, but don't know if it is better to pipe or create a redirect.  I would appreciate some direction.  Thanks!!! 
 ::Hi Brian... when it comes to full names (as in the example above) its probably best just to get rid of the middle name (this can get tricky in pageantry where names are often used in full where they are not used in full in common usage).  As for Erica Commeau... that was probably my fault!  What you did with Eurlyne/Arlene Howell was perfect  just what I would have done had I picked up on it.  There's no hard and fast rule but I'd say that if you can prevent a redirect by piping... go for it (or simply by chopping out the middle name as suggested).

"I think the paragraph regarding the recommended size of the squares and pieces is helpful, but it puts too much emphasis on one specific size.

"""*While this is good work, there are some problems.  It is an argumentative essay, and not an encyclopaedic article.  In addition there are some assumptions, """"Their traditional place had been in the domestic sphere"""" which are inappropriate to make (as they are wrong—traditional isn't expanded out) and unnecessary to the article section.  You really need to work on your anachronistic judgements.  Women workers and officers serving in the US armed forces weren't making wide spread public political claims along these lines in 1959 or 1963.  Also the length is a serious problem for the article Vietnam War.  This would suit a section in Women in the Vietnam War or an article American women in the Vietnam War.  ( I'm not going to mention the misweighting problem here, as it isn't a problem with your text, but with the absence of coverage of South Vietnamese women of all political alignments and North Vietnamese women. )

"""==Galashiels== 
 I notice that you have added back citation tags to the Galashiels article after I removed them, the tags were added by a user in order to push their POV on the article and in order to have the Gaelic names removes from several articles, this is simply another step in their campaign. The user concerned has taken to using sockpuppets to further their POV, as is the case here.   
 :Thanks for the info. I certainly don't want to encourage a disruptive anonymous editor in an axe-grinding campaign. Nevertheless, as somebody with no interest in his or her campaign, I actually agree with the sentiment on this particular edit. I don't think it's valid to add Gaelic names for places which don't naturally have them, either in historic, or current social use of the language. That would be the province of the Gaelic edition of Wikipedia, not this English edition. I am in no way suggesting that Gala fits that description — I don't know if it does or doesn't — but that's the whole point of asking for a reference, isn't it? I think it would be within the spirit (and rules, I dare say) of Wikipedia to provide a reference showing that the name is really used, and not just a transliteration. Obviously, """"common sense"""" sometimes is what's called for, when there is no readily available reference, but on that note I'd add that I have a relative in Gala and have been a visitor to the town on many occasions, and can't recall ever seeing the Gaelic name on any signs, or hearing it used (for what little that's worth). 
 :In short, I'm more than happy to see these names if they're genuine, but find them to be a political campaign in and of themselves if they're made up by Gaelic speakers purely for these articles. –  ('''')  

 ==Chiswick warning notice== 
 Hi, Kierant. I am puzzled by the warning notice (for lack of references) you inserted in the notable people section of Chiswick. What exactly do you expect to see here? Are you saying that the fact of local residence should be referenced, or are you asking about the notability of the people? If the second, the references should be in the individuals’ articles. If the first, some have suitable references within their own articles – for example, the article on Anthony Burgess, the first name on the list, includes a note of his Chiswick residence. But I am sure this is not the case with all the names, and I am concerned about the amount of work needed if this point is to become general within all the similar sections in all the local area articles. Do you intend to insert your notice in each and every such article? None I have looked at so far have this particular type of reference – nor has anyone else inserted a warning notice for that reason. Yes, I know that a high standard of scholarship is required, but this must vary according to the importance of the fact in question; and the residence of all those notable folk is not of major importance. Don’t you think you have gone a bit over the top in this? I would like to see the notice removed, please.   

 :Hi. This list of notables is particularly long, and provides no background information at all, being just a list. These are prone to unsubstantiated edits. It is of course preposterous to expect every sentence in an article to carry a reference, but a list like this needs backup — in every article in which it appears. That's a fundamental part of Wikipedia (please refer to WP:ATT). It's not always necessary to insert a warning/contribution request tag if the list isn't getting out of hand or the information is known by common sense; but they tend to start to be somewhat regulated when they get long, as this one now hopefully has. Please compare with the discussion at Talk:Bow, London about the same issue. A good deal of excellent work has gone in to sourcing the data in that article for another area of the same city. –  ('''')  

 ::Thank you. The Bow reference is interesting, both for the approach to the list and for the passions aroused! I think that the main points to consider for Chiswick are: 
 ::# Each name on the list should have a line to itself, with a brief note of the reason for its inclusion. This allows you or someone else to add to each line a separate request for citation if needed, rather than a single whallop of a warning; it allows vandalism to be more easily spotted; and it is much easier to read and comprehend.

 == Please don't edit articles that pertain to yourself! == 

 I don't know how to put this without making you feel got at, so I shall just plunge in and hope for the best. 

 I've just read this page plus Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Cheryl Kaye Tardif, , ,  and . This seems like a textbook example of why Wikipedia editors should not edit articles which pertain to themselves. Ecophreek gave some useful links above: let me pick out a few highlights. 
 *You should wait for others to write an article about subjects in which you are personally involved. This applies to articles about you, your achievements, your business, your publications, your website, your relatives, and any other possible conflict of interest. WP:AUTO 

 *[Autobiographies] are often biased, usually positively. People have a tendency towards self-aggrandizement when talking about themselves, and for presenting opinions as facts. WP:AUTO#The problem with autobiographies 

 *Note that anything you submit can be edited by others. Several autobiographical articles have been a source of dismay to their original authors after a period of editing by the community, and in at least four instances have been listed for deletion by their original authors. In some cases the article is kept even if the original author requests otherwise. People are generally unable to determine whether they are themselves encyclopedic. WP:AUTO#Creating an article about yourself 

 *Wikipedia is not, therefore, a forum for advertising or a vanity press.  WP:VAIN#Vain vs. encyclopedic 

 ===The """"official"""" article=== 
 Actually, there isn't one. It's one of the strange features of WP that articles remain live and continue to be changed, for good or for ill. I could list both good and bad results of this, but since it's the Way Things Are (at least presently), anyone contributing to WP has to get used to the idea that there isn't a """"definitive"""" version which they can maintain. The AfD process decided to keep the title """"Cheryl Kaye Tardif"""" if a decent article could be made of it: this doesn't constitute a particular version being the """"approved"""" one. 

 ===Ownership=== 
 Some of what you wrote above certainly gave the impression that you felt ownership for articles pertaining to you. (""""I have now edited my Cheryl Kaye Tardif page and my Whale Song page,"""" """"I think I'll keep the pages basic"""", """" I'll accept your help, but you are going to have to compromise as well."""")  

 You don't get to say yea or nay to any editor working on any page. You can put your case and try to convince others what should be in an article, but its not yours and you have no special say over it. Actually, in this case you're lucky to have found an editor such as Ecophreek, who is willing to incorporate information which you post here on your talk page, or on the talk page of Cheryl Kaye Tardif. I think these can be fruitful relationships, as the subject of an article will probably keep closer watch on their clippings than the other editor. 

 So I was glad to read that you are not claiming any ownership of these articles. It would be great if you could rephrase the statement on your user page to better reflect this (as it stands it's open to misinterpretation). 

 ===Bruised egos=== 
 One problem of editing articles about oneself is that it is easy to take changes to an article personally, which can lead to undue conflict with other editors. You have been sarcastic and mildly aggressive to , including accusing her of lack of objectivity (""""you have not been perhaps as objective towards me or my articles as you should be"""" ), when as far as I can see she has been nothing but neutral and helpful.  

 You have also got into actual conflict with . Lgh's comments were certainly uncivil when talking about you as an editor (bad boy!). But you say """"That was not the place to air your opinionated viewpoint of me as a writer, or to predict my """"destined"""" failure."""" . Although in this instance the criticism did not contribute towards the article, in general it's precisely appropriate to discuss publically on WP issues which affect notability, and to include literary criticism of a work (which may not be constructive criticism!) or properly referenced criticism of a person (ditto!). This may mean you read things that you don't like, and WP:CIVIL does not cover the content of articles.

 :Question 2 (the first one): Not particularly. When loading an image that is smaller than the full resolution, I believe that most browsers will load the full image size and shrink it for the thumbnail (not 100% sure, and I'm sure it varies from browser to browser). I just didn't want to make the image so tall that there is a large amount of white space above and below the text. If there was a gain, it would be negligable anyway. 
 :Question 2 (the second one): The image in question is a .SVG file. The nature of a Scalable Vector Graphics means that larger or smaller images are completely unnecessary: the image quality and size are the same at every conceivable resolution of the thumbnail. Not to mention that manually swapping them out would take months, even a bot would take many days to complete such a task. 
 :Question 3: We could, but I'm not at all convinced that it would be worth doing. The current solution works perfectly fine, and I don't see any potential gain for the amount of tedious man-hours it would take to replace the current usage.

This isn't an attempt to influence your comment, merely to explain that my oppose isn't for anything so trivial as a ill-judged warning.

 I know this isn't exactly the right forum in which to bring this up, but I am not very familiar with the Wikipedia policy regarding GDFL violations for other websites copying Wikipedia material without reference, nor have I personally contributed any of the material on this page which has been copied.  However, I found during some web browsing on dog breeds that the site www.dogbreedadvice.com appears to have copied a great deal of information from this page and pages on other dog breeds, without noticeable attribution to Wikipedia. An example can be seen at ; most of the other pages about specific dog breeds appear to have been copied wholesale from the Wikipedia entry on that breed, as well, again with no attribution that I could find. This is of course a violation of the GFDL, and also does a disservice to the hardworking Wikipedians who brought this article up to a high enough standard that it has become worth copying. (Yay, they're copying us! Boo, they're not giving us credit!)

 == Caligari == 

 I would like to edit the 1930 section to the following, however, the protection level prohibits it.  The addition of Caligari is cited and its role in the Zombie genre should be presented for completion. 

 In 1932, Victor Halperin directed White Zombie, a horror film starring Bela Lugosi. This film, capitalizing on the same voodoo zombie themes as Seabrook's book of three years prior, is often regarded as the first legitimate zombie film ever made.Roberts, Lee. """"White Zombie is regarded as the first zombie film"""", November 2006. However, arguments have been made that the 'somnambulism' in the German expressionist film The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari (1919) was an earlier example, involving a character in a state similar to that exhibited by zombies.  In White Zombie, the zombies are depicted as mindless, unthinking henchmen under the spell of an evil magician.  Zombies, often still using this voodoo-inspired rationale, were initially uncommon in cinema, but their appearances continued sporadically from the 1930s to the 1960s,Search results for keyword """"zombie"""", Internet Movie Database with notable films including Revolt of the Zombies (1936), King of the Zombies (1941), I Walked With a Zombie (1943), Revenge of the Zombies (1943), The Plague of the Zombies (1966), and the infamous Plan 9 From Outer Space (1959). 

 Someone please paste it in regular size.  Additionally, a new section for the appropriate date of before 1920 may need to be added to maintain format consistancy.  Thanks.

It's an interesting question, but strikes me oddly, as  I would hope you (or anyone who edits at Wikipedia for that matter) would be intelligent and unprejudiced enough to be able to  judge my comments and edits on their merit, rather than dismissing them out of hand as coming from a vandal or (I forget what other appellations you mentioned) simply on the basis of the color of my username.

 want to go into every detail. You will see this on other wiki pages like """"kannada"""", """"karnataka"""" , """"Bangalore"""", """"south India"""", """"India monarchs"""" etc. It was i who brought about proof that the first 
 inscription  (890AD) with the name """"begaluru"""" on it recorded by a historian in 1914 AD and that the Inscription is in """"old Kannada"""" (just as an example), when a war was going on between telugu and Kannada guys about the origin of the name of my city.So please dont patronize me.

 *I think North8000 is right here.  If we had a picture of the exact gun, and yes, we likely will have a fair use copy in time, then it would be less problematic, but we are adding original research if we are putting up images that are """"kind of like"""" the gun used.  That alone is enough reason to pause.  Secondarily, we have to ask the question we ask of all photos: Does this add context to the article?  I would argue that the value of the image is very limited.  Semi-automatic weapons of the AR15 class are hardly rare, and the image doesn't add much more than the description does, which being wikilinked, means that anyone truly ignorant of what an """"assault"""" rifle looks like in general can click over.  By adding a gun image that is potentially significantly different in modification than the original, we may be adding more disinformation than information.  When faced with this possibility, weighed against the dubious value the image adds, then excluding an image until the real gun picture can be obtained, or at least an image with a very high possibility of being identical, is the better option. WP:OR seems to be the primary factor here, as it is obvious we don't have enough information to determine exactly what the gun and its modifications look like at this time.  -    Join WER """,9faa9b4adc30d4d8,0.003341834196309131,0.008306521636247585,0.005799171825547964,0.0019556927988703394,0.0015657260595223683,0.011415764096205885

 Am Basically an animation student, currently doing my B.sc in Animation and Film Making, and i also do freelance designing works too, like  
 Broucher design, logo designs, flyers, lot more designing stuffs, learnt a lot from my daily mistakes improved it now giving the best quality to the customers. I always have interests in all kind of arts. When I was a kid I had my own computer. I had the opportunity to work on it. I think I was 8-9 years old. But of course I used the computer for games painting and stuffs like that i was inspired a lot by games i used to sketch those stuffs i used to love drawing but a long gap i lost the touch and got used to computer and the wonderful software which is playing a huge success in my life and am loving it.I have been learning Photoshop on my own. In the beginning I made all my projects for me without aim. At that time I didn't have much Photoshop tutorials and I had to experiment with this program. Little by little it became my hobby. I could remember that I had interest in matte painting but not for a long time. Graphic Design will be my love forever.I think that everyone can find the inspiration that it needs in everything around us. I find inspiration in music, people, nature, movies and other artist too. I usually spend more time in watching something then working. The ideas often come in that way. But maybe the biggest inspiration we can find in our imagination.When I start a new project the main idea that I have at the beginning of the work often change to another. In the process of work a new idea and inspiration appear so I can change the whole conception. I often start something then another… I forgot the first that I start and after a couple of months for example I come back to this unfinished work again.I always make experiment on new techniques. I always try to mention innovations with every new project. I mix different styles and techniques trying to find something new.I’d love to do the posters and covers for a major film. I think a lot of modern film posters are boring and are just a photoshopped up image of the main character. It would be awesome to do something for a film that has a bit of character to it such as a Tarantino film. At last i have some basic knowledge of editing stuffs too i get movie stuffs too but held up with loads of designing stuffs i have given a pause for them as of now i will shortly work on those too.",2626c767546eb4e0,0.0033722270942624396,0.017839879334660705,0.016669903189416392,0.003564178084156107,0.0021340727245034367,0.02848248238346563

Maybe you don't understand how Twitter works, and in fact there is verification that the account is Morrison's. I know you have all of these badges, and wikipedia medallions and whatnot but just because you don't understand what certain edits mean, does not mean they are not encyclopedic. 

 And by the way, encyclopedic means comprehensive, so reverting comprehensive edits (which it has seemed to be an issue with other users as seen below) is actually not encyclopedic.

 By the way, have you thought about archiving your user talk page?  Now it's so large, and has so many sections, that it's difficult to edit.  The New Section button is not displaying, nor are the Edit links for each section, and it also takes a long time to edit and save any changes.  You can see how to do this at Help:Archiving a talk page.  Or if you like, I'll be glad to do it for you.

 == Maryam Babangida == 

 Your recent drastic changes to this article are not constructive:  
 #You have removed most of the sources for the article. All content should have sources.  
 #You have added a source (""""Shamed By Their Nation"""") which does not mention the subject at all, talking only about her husband.  
 #You have removed relevant information about the women's programs, the """"glamorous persona"""" and the news reports on reaction to her death. 
 Her husband's regime was corrupt and harmed the progress of democracy in Nigeria. That is marginally relevant and is pointed out in the previous version. Maryam enjoyed the """"first lady"""" role, attending major social events dressed up in elaborate costumes and being discussed in the gossip columns. She was a celebrity. The article is incomplete without that information. Maryam put much effort into women's causes. Whatever the motives, that deserves more than one sentence. Her death triggered a flood of news articles, mostly positive. That is relevant. 

 A Wikipedia article should give balanced and verifiable coverage of all significant aspects of the subject. You should not remove references to sources, or remove relevant material. If you feel that there are other aspects that should be covered, add material (with sources) on the other aspects. If you feel that the sources reflect one bias, add sources that reflect the other bias. """"Some looked up to her ... others resented her"""". I do not want to get into an edit war, but am unwilling to accept the article as it stands. I strongly encourage you to revert your last edit, then expand the article to add additional material that makes the article more complete and balanced.

I think the difference in interpretation hangs on whether there was an unambiguous offer to end partition from London to Dublin, over the head of Craig, in return for joining the Allies, or an offer to discuss the matter.

 Greetings, 

 This user 

 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:John_J._Bulten 

 is pushing his anti-science, fundamentalist views, engaging in original research, and now edit-warring. 

 He is an editor from a right-wing, ideological website and is thus pushing an agenda. His edits are akin to anti-science fundamentalists attempting to take over articles on Darwinism and evolution. 

 In any case, this certainly needs the attention of a third-party, reliable admin.  

 ===Pre-seed=== 
 ? in re:  and  

 Looks like you deleted Pre-Seed and I blocked the original editor for username vios.  Can you take a look at the notes the new user has left on  about wanting to try again.  There are a bunch of different issues (copyvio / OR) that they have introduced through their requests, but in the spirit of growing (rather than limiting) the project I was thinking about giving them another chance as long as they are willing to follow the rules.  Your thoughts?    
 : I'm not inclined to cut much slack for coi spas.  If the product has truly achieved notability, it shouldn't be difficult for uninvolved parties to write an appropriately sourced and encylopedic article about it.  You may get more feedback on the COI noticeboard.  –

 == Critics of preterism from [blank] perspective == 

 I think that is unnecessary.  What I think would be useful is to add parenthetical comments after a particular critic IF necessary.  For instance, my site hosts criticisms from ALL perspectives, I don't care if they are futurist or historicist.  Other sites do so as well.  If there are particular sites that wanted to be noted as Historicist Critics then that should be added as a parenthetical comment. 

 And of course I am with Roderick and Theonomy - NPOV requires reporting all views in an accurate matter.  The idea is educationn not indoctrination. 

 I do plan on making the edits that Theonomy and I discussed above, I just haven't had time.  I also am awaiting feedback then on that """"critics"""" comment I made above because having all those subcategories just doesn't reflect the reality of how sites are organized.

 I'm sorry it cost you time and editing, but please stop going into good articles and start editing. You've not been here long enough to know the actual work that has already gone into articles like this and your edits are not progressive. I spent a great deal of time updating the filmography table to the present format used and added in the awards confirmed for Adams. You undid the formatting of the table for some reason. Since you did all of the additions in one huge edit, it isn't possible to sort out what edits might be considered valid and what is not. From the start of the article, you added the marriage template, which is not valid for a domestic partnership, you changed and added section titles with no support from article editors who worked this up to the good article status, you changed corrections to formatting for short films, I have no clue what you've done to the listings in the table, but one time minor appearances in some TV shows are no reason to disrupt it this way.

 == Jihad in Islamic Law == 

 The meaning of Jihad in the classical manuals of Islamic jurisprudence needs to be better represented or emphasised in this article. Bernard Lewis is cited and his opinion is that in most of the recorded history of Islam, the word jihad was used in a primarily military sense. I would suggest it would be better and more authentic to quote straight from Islamic law. In 'Umdat al-Salik (Reliance of the Traveller) for example, the connotation of warfare with Jihad is made clearer: 

 :Jihad means to war against non-Muslims, and is etymologically derived from the word mujahada signifying warfare to establish the religion. And it is the lesser jihad. As for the greater jihad, it is spiritual warfare against the lower self (nafs), which is why the Prophet (Allah bless him and give him peace) said as he was returning from jihad. 
 :``We have returned from the lesser jihad to the greater jihad. 

 :The scriptural basis for jihad, prior to scholarly consensus (def: b7) is such Koranic verses as: 

 :-1- ``Fighting is prescribed for you (Koran 2:216); 

 :-2- ``Slay them wherever you find them (Koran 4:89); 

 :-3- ``Fight the idolators utterly (Koran 9:36); 

 :and such hadiths as the one related by Bukhari and Muslim that the Prophet (Allah bless him and give him peace) said: 

 :``I have been commanded to fight people until they testify that there is no god but Allah and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah, and perform the prayer, and pay zakat. If they say it, they have saved their blood and possessions from me, except for the rights of Islam over them. And their final reckoning is with Allah; 

 :and the hadith reported by Muslim, 

 :``To go forth in the morning or evening to fight in the path of Allah is better than the whole world and everything in it.Details concerning jihad are found in the accounts of the military expeditions of the Prophet (Allah bless him and give him peace), including his own martial forays and those on which he dispatched others. The former consist of the ones he personally attended, some twenty-seven (others say twenty-nine) of them. He fought in eight of them, and killed only one person with his noble hand, Ubayy ibn Khalaf, at the battle of Uhud. On the latter expeditions he sent others to fight, himself remaining at Medina, and these were forty-seven in number.) [...] 

 :The caliph (o25) makes war upon Jews, Christians, and Zoroastrians (N: provided he has first invited them to enter Islam in faith and practice, and if they will not, then invited them to enter the social order of Islam by paying the non-Muslim poll tax (jizya, def: o11.4) -which is the significance of their paying it, not the money itself-while remaining in their ancestral religions) (O: and the war continues) until they become Muslim or else pay the non-Muslim poll tax (O: in accordance with the word of Allah Most High, 

 :""""Fight those who do not believe in Allah and the Last Day and who forbid not what Allah and His messenger have forbidden-who do not practice the religion of truth, being of those who have been given the Book-until they pay the poll tax out of hand and are humbled"""" (Koran 9.29)Reliance of the Traveller: A Classic Manual of Islamic Sacred Law, p. 599  

 As to whether this book is a reliable source I will point to that in Umdat al-Salik we find various endorsments and probably the most important is from Al-Azhar University which is the chief centre of Arabic literature and Sunni Islamic learning in the world, and Al-Azhar certified in 1991 that Umdat al-Salik """"conformes to the practice and faith of the orthodox Sunni Community.""""Reliance of the Traveller: A Classic Manual of Islamic Sacred Law, p. xx (20)    """,7793ee9b14fdcd91,0.004644419379486488,0.015183745278080977,0.011027147451077156,0.0030675186690686616,0.0017216097252925582,0.01859424205730264
"Removed this paragraph due to plagarism: 

 A Detroit native whose entry into the comedy scene wasn't entirely intentional, the former performance artist decided to try her hand at humor when a non-comedic performance at the San Francisco Art Institute elicited unexpected laughs from the audience. Subsequently realizing the absurdity inherent in overly serious performance art, Rajskub soon adjusted her act to become a parody of performance art. The unique take on live comedy quickly caught on with audiences, and shortly thereafter, Rajskub was approached by Bob Odenkirk and David Cross and asked to join the cast of their upcoming HBO stream-of-consciousness comedy series Mr. Show. A somewhat bitter falling out with series co-creator Cross found Rajskub departing from the series after a year to take a job at Seattle's Best Coffee, but her career as a caffeine dealer would quickly come to an end when Garry Shandling caught wind of her act.

 == New Article Deletion == 

 I noticed that you removed the new Morris Mohawk Gaming Group article that I created yesterday and redirected to the """"Bodog"""" article.  I would question this decision.  Bodog is the trademark and, of course, deserves its place in the encyclopedia for its significant history in the online gaming space as well as other sectors.  However, the MMGG is the operator of one of the largest online gaming sites in the world and is a significant player in the industry.  I realize that the MMGG is mentioned in the Bodog article as a brand licensee, but the removed article presented considerable additional information that would not have been appropriate on a Bodog article.  I took great pains to ensure that the facts were accurately researched and properly sourced, including securing directly from the MMGG permission to post their logo, which took several days.  Unlike PartyPoker or Full Tilt, the brand """"Bodog"""" is not the equivalent of group actually operating and developing one of the more significant sites in a relatively controversial sector.  By way of analogy, Ceasar's Palace has its own Wikipedia article, but so does Harrah's, the company that owns and operates that brand.  I will wait for your response before seeking to re-post to be certain I understand the rationale for removal, but would ask that this be reconsidered.

""" 

 Now, let's untangle this before my talk page becomes a battleground.  

 #Last August, I wrote a sarcastic note to a certain contributor who had reverted one of my edits. The person took it badly, qualifying it a """"message full of hatred"""", which it was not - compared to some rude & crude exchanges one can read on Wikipedia, mine was more witty than anything else, and it contained no vulgarity.  
 #, (whom I never thanked, but do no), had understood my note in the tone it was written, and intervened in my favor. 
 # stepped in qualifying my message of “uncivil behavior”, which it was not. 
 #The person who had been offended by my words went on Serge Woodzing talk page & thanked him.  Again, the “message full of hatred” was mentioned, then  “that particular contributor” who was the “worst nightmare” Mr. Woodzing “had ever had so far”.  
 #Since Mr. Woodzing and myself had had a few sharp exchanges a few months earlier on a royalty page, I took his “nightmare” to be me.   

 Mr. Woodzing, this sounds more to me like a comedy of errors, and now you call me a “problem” & want me to apologize. I always apologize, but only for my faults.  In this instance, and in view of the circumstances, the time and the strange writing that made it sound as if I was your """"worst nightmare"""", what fault did I make toward you that demands an apology on my part?  All I did on 14 August was write a single message to someone, not to you. When you chose to step in & qualified my message of """"uncivil behavior"""" – which it was not -  you stuck your neck out because you had no idea why I had written that message. So I took your words as being aimed at me personally, hence my comment at Clotilde de France talk page.  

 All I can say is that I am sorry such an imbroglio took place and that it is disturbing you. I really do not want you to get sick over it, or over anything else, nor do I want to be one of your """"worst or best nightmares"""".  

 Monsieur, je ne peux pas vous demander pardon pour une faute que je n'ai pas commise, et toutefois vous souhaite une bonne nuit pleine de beaux rêves.

 Sounds like they are the spiritual children of Charles Coughlin (an American catholic fascist of the depression era) from the Assumption University (Windsor) in Windsor, Ontario, 
 formerly Assumption College, where he was teaching, and where his teachings are still held in high esteem? (If you read TheGoodson, I am ashamed to be a German, I will give up my German citizenship) 

 That means, we are condemned to relive history again and again, over and over, like the Flying Dutchman? We are in a time loop? Or is it the afterlife, where we have to review our deeds? We are directly approaching the next instance of the """"New Deal""""? I will now have immediately to go and shake the moth balls out of my uniform and grow a mustache, as it is only 5 years into the future that we will finally prevail, march into Poland, beat the Bolsheviki to a pulp and then breed Nietzsches blonde beast, tough as leather, hard as Krupp-steel? Poor me.. The Bush flavor of corporatism on the dawn of a new fascism, driven by the new depression... 

 Remains the question: if this club is really one person, why would they revert each other in many repetitive edits on zodiac etc, why would they appear as the braindead feeble minded editor, who does not understand citations, and as the educated understanding academic who corrects him? Is this a funny role playing game, like """"good cop-bad cop""""? Why would they generate such an immense amount of chaff in the zodiac domain, except to obfuscate the traffic and their identity? If we subtract all this as periodic background noise, per autocorrelation (periodic because it goes forth and back and forth and back without much care for variation or any progress in sense), what remains is a keen interest in drug abuse, political extremism, and in the related law. Quack, Quack! 

 I always thought police intelligence is an oxymoron, but I didn't think the intelligence community has a kindergarten too. Maybe self proclaimed moral watchers disrupting WP with disinformation? You never know, the US is rich with nut cases. 

 Regarding TheGoodsons German nationalist pride and the glorification of Nazi history, I will add that no German in his right mind of the generation born into the afterwar misery will be proud of anything our parent generation did. 

 Our life is overshadowed by the feelings of guilt and sorrow about the atrocities in the name of our people. 
  	   
 Our hope has been that our generation would learn from the past.  

 Insofar the snotty remarks of TheGoodson are nothing but a misguided caricature of the German views of history of every reasonable German. I would wish he would keep his big unwashed mouth shut, and I may say that we don't want people of his breed to claim German heritage. They are an abomination, and if history really repeats itself they will be the white henchmen of new murderous fascism.

"Picture === 

 I'm not happy with the picture of M33. 

 M33 is one of the 'biggest', galaxies in the northern hemisphere and a favorite target for astrophotographers and amateur astronomers.  
 But what one will see (on a 'normal' photography - or with a fast Telescope) is completeley different from what the picture shows us here. One have to open the picture and read the full description to understand that this image shows the Ultraviolet-Part of the spectrum - which is invisible to the human eye! This means what the picture shows can never be seen this way - and even worst, some really brigt, yellow stars completeley dissapear from the picture, since they are relativeley dark in the UV-Spectrum. The same is true for many of the really interesting details which can be seen in the visible spectrum, especially dust and many 'nebulae'. Even the interesting region NGC601 which is discussed in the article is just visible as a tiny white dot without any structure. Not to talk about the lifeless false-colors. 
 Dont take me wrong, the NASA-Picture from Spitzer is very interesting - but just a bit missplaced at this point. It's somehow as if a wiki-article about a well known person would show an x-ray of his head instead of a 'normal' photograph... 

 Therefore, I replace the picture with a photography I made by mysef with a typical small (20cm) amateur-telescope and a optimized digital SLR (Canon 20Da). 
 Sure it's not a perfect astronomy picture - but it shows a lot more details as the one from spitzer, has a much better resolution (one can even identify NGC601). And it shows how the galaxy really looks like in - more or less - real colors! 
 I'm sure there are much better amateur-pictures or professionel real-color-pictures of M31 out there. I'm happy to see my picture replaced with a significantly better one - but please dont replace it with a picture showing infrared, x-ray, ultraviolett or any other invisible radiation.

 == Falkland Islands Again == 

   I'll repeat what I said at WP:NPOVN.  The article is about self-determination, the obsessive demand that we include the Argentine POV that an event in 1833 is viewed as an invasion is completely misplaced.  The article should be a brief precis about the role of self-determination in relation to the Falkland Islands Dispute.  That particular comment is completely and utterly irrelevant.  Langus has reverted to a poorly written text that repeats the phrase """"Argentine POV"""" no less than THREE times, TWICE in one paragaph.  I'd edited the article to reframe the debate, describing the differing POV from a neutral perspective, based on academic sources. Instead we have a reversion to version of text spitting out the political POV of the Argentine Government repeatedly. We don't achieve NPOV by stating the POV of either the Argentine or British Governments, we achieve it by describing the debate from a neutral perspective.  The WP:BATTLE mentality that is so obsessive about inserting the Argentine POV into each and every article has to stop and I'm getting mightily fed up with all of my edits being reverted by Langus and him following me from article to article as that is clearly hounding, it stops now or I'm going to take this to WP:ANI.
